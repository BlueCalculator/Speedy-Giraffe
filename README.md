Now with this Chrome extension, on YouTube or any other video, the controller will set the video content time to video duration skipping the ad completely. This is faster and more effective than increasing video speed by 16x as before. 
**Also**, This Chrome extension can manipulate your video. Like toggleable fast-forward, skipping forward and backward! You can also set different skip amounts and video speed amounts. 

# USE 

To add to your Chrome you will need to enable developer mode for extensions and load the folder in "load Unpacked."


I'll add more and better features later.
