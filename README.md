With this Chrome extension, you can now skip ads entirely on YouTube and other video platforms by setting the video content time to the video duration. This method is quicker and more efficient than the previous approach of increasing video speed by 16x. Additionally, the extension offers various video manipulation features, such as toggleable fast-forward, and the ability to skip forward and backward. You can also customize skip intervals and adjust the video playback speed to your preference.

# USE 

To add to your Chrome you will need to enable developer mode for extensions and load the folder in "Load Unpacked"
